First off, this tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with the terminal, JS/HTML/CSS, and an editor of some kind.
As new concepts are introduced, please check out the resources we provide and revisit as necessary. We will be
focussing on the very highest level features.

Now, to kick things off, we will need [node.js]("http://nodejs.org/"), so install if you need to.

We'll need [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) as well, you might as well install it too while
you're at it.

<div class='NOTE'>
<p>
If you're on OS X, it's better to install node via [homebrew](http://brew.sh) or
use TJ Holowaychuck's [n](http://github.com/tj/n).
</p>
<p>
Here's a one-liner to quickly install `n`:
<pre><code>
(git clone https://github.com/tj/n.git /tmp/_n_ && cd /tmp/_n_ && make && n stable)
</code></pre>
</p>
