        ### Overview
        Poe is a collection of open-source tools for web developers, and Poe UI is its front-end framework.
        Although we refer to it as a framework, Poe UI is not a framework in the traditional sense that it
        has a distinctive and novel approach to specific problems; it's not written in a new and exciting language;
        in some ways it's quite plain.

        That said, you would be hard pressed to match in performace, extensibility, and productivity. Poe UI
        works well as a quick static site and serves just as easily for standalone applications. But it's real
        purpose and strength is working hand-in-hand with a hypermedia API.

        Before we get too ahead ourselves, let's start with the basics by generating a skeleton Poe UI app locally.

        | Getting Started

      p
        | First off, this tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with the terminal, JS/HTML/CSS, and an editor of some kind.
        | As new concepts are introcued, please check out the resources we provide and revisit as necessary. We will be
        | focussing on the very highest level features.

      p
        | Now, to kick things off, we will need <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, so install if necessary.

      .NOTE
        | If you're on OS X, it's better to install node via **[homebrew](http://brew.sh)**.

    .subsection
      h3
        | Hello World

      p
        | Start by opening your terminal and install a command line utility for generating new Poe UI apps.

      code.block
        | npm install --global poe-ui

      p
        | After install finishes, navigate to an empty directory somewhere. This will be our app\'s root.

      code.block
        | mkdir ~/Projects/poe-app
        | cd ~/Projects/poe-app
        | poe-ui-create

      p
        | At this point you\'ll be prompted to give your app a name, and optional description and organization. Once
        | everything has been created, you can start the app by running

      code.block
        | npm install
        | make start

      .WARNING
        | If you're receiving long log messages, go
        | <a href="https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/component/getting-started.md#setup-authentication">here</a>
        | and make sure you are properly exposing your github credentials. If you aren\'t, you will only have 60 requests to make; after
        | that your requests will be refused until you set up your account.

      p
        | After a moment to install dependencies, our output should look something like this:

      code.block
        | 14:38:42 web.1   | started with pid 44663
        | 14:38:42 web.1   | [LR] auto-reload enabled
        | 14:38:42 web.1   | Server listening on port 5000

      .NOTE
        p
          | This log style may look familiar to you; we are using **[foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)** to
          | run on your machine exactly as it does in production.
        p
          | This means the app is up an running. So now if we navigate in our browser to `localhost:5000`, we can see the
          | default initialized app ready for us.
