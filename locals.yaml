#         Poe is a collection of open-source tools for web developers, and Poe UI
#         is its front-end framework. Although we refer to it as a framework, Poe
#         UI is not a framework in the traditional sense that it has a distinctive
#         and novel approach to specific problems; it\'s not written in a new and
#         exciting language; in some ways it\'s quite plain.

#         That said, you would be hard pressed to match in performace, extensibility, and productivity. Poe UI works well as a quick static site and serves just as easily for standalone applications. But it\'s real purpose and strength is working hand-in-hand with a hypermedia API.

#         Before we get too ahead ourselves, let's start with the basics by generating a skeleton Poe UI app locally.

#         First off, this tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with the terminal, JS/HTML/CSS, and an editor of some kind.
#         As new concepts are introcued, please check out the resources we provide and revisit as necessary. We will be
#         focussing on the very highest level features.

#         Now, to kick things off, we\'ll need **[node.js](http://nodejs.org/)**, so install if necessary.
