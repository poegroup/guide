  Poe is a collection of open-source tools for web developers, and Poe UI is its front-end framework.
  Although we refer to it as a framework, Poe UI is not a framework in the traditional sense that it
  has a distinctive and novel approach to specific problems; it's not written in a new and exciting language;
  in some ways it's quite plain.

  That said, you would be hard pressed to match in performace, extensibility, and productivity. Poe UI
  works well as a quick static site and serves just as easily for standalone applications. But it's real
  purpose and strength is working hand-in-hand with a hypermedia API.

  Before we get too ahead ourselves, let's start with the basics by generating a skeleton Poe UI app locally.
