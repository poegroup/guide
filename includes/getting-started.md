First off, this tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with the terminal, JS/HTML/CSS, and an editor of some kind.
As new concepts are introcued, please check out the resources we provide and revisit as necessary. We will be
focussing on the very highest level features.

Now, to kick things off, we will need [node.js]("http://nodejs.org/"), so install if necessary.

<div class='NOTE'>
If you're on OS X, it's better to install node via **[homebrew](http://brew.sh)**.
