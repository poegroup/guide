<p>  Let&#39;s start with the basics by generating a skeleton Poe UI app locally.</p>
</div><div id="getting-started" class="subsection"><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>First off, this tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with the terminal, JS/HTML/CSS, and an editor of some kind.
As new concepts are introduced, please check out the resources we provide and revisit as necessary. We will be
focussing on the very highest level features.</p>
<p>Now, to kick things off, we will need <a href="&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;">node.js</a>, so install if necessary.</p>
<div class='NOTE'>
If you&#39;re on OS X, it&#39;s better to install node via <strong><a href="http://brew.sh">homebrew</a></strong> or
use TJ Holowaychuck&#39;s <strong><a href="http://github.com/tj/n">n</a></strong>.
</div>
</div><div id="hello-world" class="subsection"><h3>Hello World</h3><p>Start by opening your terminal and installing the <a href="https://github.com/poegroup/poe">poe</a> command line tool.</p>
<p><code class='block'>
npm i -g poe
</code></p>
<p>After install finishes, navigate to an empty directory somewhere. This will be our app&#39;s root.</p>
<p><code class='block'>
mkdir ~/Projects/my-app
cd ~/Projects/my-app
poe create ui
</code></p>
<p>At this point you&#39;ll be prompted for a project name, description, and any other required fields.
Set the <code>port</code> field to 5000, and the <code>api url</code> to <code>http://localhost:5001</code>.
Once instantiated, you can start the app by running</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">make start
</code></pre>
<div class='WARNING'>
If you receive a warning message, go
<a href="https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/component/getting-started.md#setup-authentication">here</a>
and ensure your github credentials are exposed properly.
</div>

<p>After a moment to install dependencies, our output should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">14:38:42 web.1   | started with pid 44663
14:38:42 web.1   |    info : auto-reload enabled
14:38:42 web.1   | Server listening on port 5000
</code></pre>
<div class='NOTE'>
This log style may look familiar to you; we are using <strong><a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">foreman</a></strong> to
run on your machine exactly as it does in production.
</div>

<p>It says it&#39;s listening, so let&#39;s navigate in our browser to <code>localhost:5000</code>.</p>

</div><p>An <code>.env</code> file controls your environment. Unlike other project files, it should not be
version controlled, as doing so may reveal sensitive information.</p>
<p>Your environment variables are the most fundamental values to your application, and in your Poe app it will likely
provide your api&#39;s url at the very least.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">API_URL=http://localhost:5001

}</div><p><a href="http://component.github.io/">Component</a> is a static asset tool. It&#39;s a dependency manager, distributor
as well as a general-purpose task runner. You can think of it as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</a> for all
things static: javascript, styles, images, fonts, etc.</p>
<p>To install, update, or remove components from your project, you can either</p>
<ul>
<li>edit your project&#39;s <code>component.json</code> file by hand (probably simpler)</li>
<li>or use the component <a href="https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/component/getting-started.md">CLI</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You don&apos;t have to worry about actually building the components however; when Poe UI run, it watches for changes
to your <code>component.json</code> and will install/remove/rebuild as necessary.</p>
<p>As far as structure goes, the <code>component.json</code> works almost identically to npm&apos;s <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<div class='.NOTE'>
Component pushed the community in a much more modular direction in 2012 - 2014, but has fallen out of popularity as
npm is becoming the standard for front- and back-end JS management. In the upcoming stable version of Poe UI this file
is replaced entirely by npm.

and in productions. Although it doesn&#39;t actually watch files when
they change, it determines which files rely on which, and how to
build as effectively as possible.</p>

keeps it&#39;s own <code>mk</code> file which is the called by your Poe app&#39;s
Makefile when you first start. So although Make has some
complex tasks under the covers, you only need one line on your
Makefile.</p>

keep simplifying.</p>
