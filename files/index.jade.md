This is the 'chrome' for our app, i.e., the area surrounding the app that remains
the same. The `main` element is where our **`public/partials/index.jade`** is loaded.

To include another partial (like a footer), simply point to the path in the `src` attribute
of an element as the **`header`** does here.

<div class='NOTE'>
Note that the path is wrapped in double quotations ("'path/here'").
</div>
